# Section Signs

## Description

Allows entering ยง (Section Sign) in all text fields within Minecraft. Warning: Using this in chat on a vanilla server will almost certainly kick you with the message "Illegal chat character".
This does work for books though, even if the server does not have the mod.

## Disclaimer

You are unlikely to be banned for using this mod, however it __is__ possible, so please be extra-careful and make sure that you have the server owner's permission.
